//! Advanced GPU Linear Algebra Operations
//!
//! This module provides advanced GPU implementations of linear algebra operations
//! including eigenvalue computation, linear system solving, matrix inversion,
//! and determinant calculation. These operations are optimized for GPU execution
//! and use established numerical algorithms adapted for parallel computation.
//!
//! All implementations are organized into separate modules for maintainability
//! and are re-exported through this module for convenience.

// TODO: Fix compilation errors in advanced submodules before enabling
// mod advanced;

// Re-export all advanced linear algebra functions
// pub use advanced::{determinant, eigenvalues, inverse, solve};
